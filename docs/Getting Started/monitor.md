Monitoring your bot project is an essential step in ensuring its success and longevity.

There are several ways you can analyze real-time information about what your bot is doing, how it is handling conversations, and any errors it might be running into.

## Event debugger

The Event Debugger is a panel located in the Botpress Studio, which you can use to understand your bot's behaviour as you're testing your bot. It shows information about test conversations you have in the emulator and is an essential step in understanding your bot's logic.

## Usage

The Usage tab details resource usage like how many messages your bot has consumed, and which bots in your workspace are consuming how many resources over time.

## Logs

The Logs tab shows a log of all actions and events taken by your bot while it's in production. This won't show any conversations that occur in the emulator. The Logs tab allows you to track all the actions your bot is taking and analyze any errors it might be running into.

## Conversations

The Conversations tab shows a log of all conversations your bot has had while it's been in production. You can view information like the user, the conversation transcript, and a summary of the conversation.

## Analytics

The Analytics tab shows detailed statistics about your bot's conversations, like how many users it's engaged with, how many of them are returning users, and how many messages are sent on average for each session.

Team Plan and Enterprise subscribers can further customize this tab as well as which events are tracked.

## Events

The Events tab details your bot's specific events as well as the status of their execution. You can quickly scan this tab for errors and to understand how to resolve any problems your bot might be running into.

## Issues

The Issues tab only shows specific problems your bot has encountered while it's been in production. You can use this tab to keep an eye on the real-time status of any errors and resolve them as needed.
