The Conversations tab is a key feature in Botpress Cloud for tracking your bot's behavior and user interaction. Once you publish and share your chatbot you can use the Conversations tab to test its ensure that it is working as intended.

One of the benefits of using the Conversations tab is that you can see how your bot is performing in real-time. This means that you can see how users are interacting with your bot - the messages they send and the replies they get. This can help you identify any issues with your bot and fix them before they become a problem for other users. It's also very useful for looking for possible improvements to the user experience and constantly refining your bot's performance and functionality.

## Features

### Listing conversations

This menu lists each conversation your bot has had, sorted by the conversation's most recent message. It provides the conversation ID, a unique identifier for each conversation, as well as an AI-generated summary of the conversation.

You can click the conversation ID to navigate to the specific conversation and view it in greater detail.

When viewing a conversation, you can click on any message to inspect its properties, like the time at which it was sent, a unique message ID, and the JSON for that specific message.
