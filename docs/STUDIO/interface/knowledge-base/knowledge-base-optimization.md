You can use the Knowledge Base Optimization feature to improve your bot's ability to respond to questions with information contained in your knowledge base.

# How to use

Optimizing improves your bot's ability to respond to queries with the information contained in your knowledge bases.

## Test

### Before optimizing

In the example below, the bot is unable to parse the user's question, and does not understand that the user is trying to query the information contained in the knowledge base.

### After optimizing

After optimizing the same example, the bot is able to take the same input and recognize that it is being asked a question that pertains to the information contained in its knowledge base.
