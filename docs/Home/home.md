Botpress enables teams of all sizes to build, deploy, and monitor AI-powered chatbots and agents. It allows you to reliably automate complex conversations, tasks, and workflows across a variety of communication channels.

The building process is split into three phases: Build, Deploy, and Monitor. 

## Build

Building on Botpress takes place primarily in the Studio, where you'll decide what kinds of conversations your bot will be able to handle, what information it knows, and what tools it has access to.

## Deploy

When you've finished building and testing your bot, Botpress makes it easy to put your bot in front of customers or team members.

## Monitor

Once your bot has been deployed, Botpress allows you to track its performance and understand if it's accomplishing its tasks correctly with a suite of analytics and logging tools.
