The Files API allows you to upload, download, and manage files and searchable documents for your bots and integrations in Botpress Cloud. You can also link your files to Knowledge Bases so that your bot may answer from it.

Files can be in any text or binary format, and documents (such as PDF, Microsoft Office, HTML, CSV, etc.) can be indexed to be used for semantic search in RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) implementations. Files are private by default but can be made publicly accessible through a permanent URL that's unique for each file.

You can connect any file uploaded to a Knowledge Base so that it may be searchable within the bot. 

You can see the Files API guide here -> [Files API](doc:files-api), or open the pages below to read the API reference.
